    ---  PSX/PS2 controller driver for Raspberry Pi 3/4 using GPIO & SPI ---

This driver is meant to support PSX/PS2 controllers, 
using the Raspberry Pi's builtin SPI hardware plus GPIO for dynamic slave select support.

Features:
    - PSX / PS2 controllers, in analog or digital mode
    - Rumble support on DualShock/DualShock 2
    - Multitap support (PSX multitap only for now)
    - Hot-plugging of inputs - if a controller is unplugged, the driver removes its associated input device.
    - Supports two controller ports, for a total of 8 controllers when 2 multitaps connected.
